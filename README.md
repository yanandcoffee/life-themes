How to theme your *Life*
------------------------
1. Download the `css` folder and place it in your life directory.
2. Push to your `gh-pages` branch.
2. In your `config.json` file, change the `customStylesheetURL` config to the path of your desired theme. The `[config.example.json](config.example.json)` in this repo is an example of how the configuration should look.

The stylesheets were designed to overwrite the default inline styles. For more documentation on how the configuration works, refer to the original [repo](https://github.com/cheeaun/life).
