How to theme your *Life*
------------------------
In your `config.json` file, point the `customStylesheetURL` to:
http://kaizora.github.io/life-themes/dist/theme.css. Replace *theme.css* with the filename of the theme. You can refer to the [Themes](#themes) section or the `css` folder for the fillename.

The [`config.example.json`](https://github.com/kaizora/life-themes/blob/master/config.example.json) in this repo is an example of how it should look.

The stylesheets were designed to overwrite the default inline styles. For more documentation on how the configuration works, refer to the original [repo](https://github.com/cheeaun/life).
